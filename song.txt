You say you don't want me
You call me good for nothing straight to my face
You say you don't need me
You call me good for nothing, a waste of space

Don't remind me
I'm minding my own damn business
Don't try to find me
I'm better left alone in this
It doesn't surprise me
Do you really think that I could care
If you really don't like me
Find somebody else
It could be anyone else out 

Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothing
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
It'll happen again
I'll watch it happen over and over again

You say you don't want me
You call me good for nothing straight to my face
You say you don't need me
You call me good for nothing, a waste of space
